## Dictamen

```text
COMPLETE_FOR_LOCAL_GOVERNED_USE: YES
COMPLETE_WITH_CONDITIONS: (subset)
  - Local schemas under docs/schemas/local (not full enterprise schema set)
  - Default plan may issue MEASURED_LOCAL_FIXTURE HITL receipt (LOCAL_BOUNDED)
  - Use --require-hitl / --hitl-receipt for external director receipt
  - Deprecated bridge exists for compat tests only; runtime does not call it
  - GH branch protection RULE_CREATED_NOT_ENFORCED (Free private); local pre-push surrogate only
  - No network production; no Fundacion mutation; fixture projects only
PRODUCTION_READY: NO
```
