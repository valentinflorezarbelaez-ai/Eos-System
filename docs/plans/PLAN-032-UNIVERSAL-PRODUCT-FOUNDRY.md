# PLAN-032: IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE FOR EOS UNIVERSAL PRODUCT FOUNDRY

## 1. Architectural Design & ADR-044

### ADR-044: Autonomous Hexagonal Product Scaffolding & Mathematical Verification Foundry
- **Status**: ACCEPTED
- **Context**: EOS requires an industrial-grade engine capable of synthesizing complete software product architectures of any complexity level (from simple utilities to planetary financial/streaming engines), ensuring 0 defects, complete traceability, and hermetic Layer-0 purity.
- **Decision**:
  1. Implement `EosUniversalProductFoundry` in `src/core/eosUniversalProductFoundry.ts`.
  2. Define `ProductManifest` supporting arbitrary domains, complexity tiers, platform targets, and compliance requirements.
  3. Implement `createProductBlueprint()` to synthesize a complete topological graph of modules, layers, contracts, and test suites.
  4. Implement `validateProductTopology()` ensuring zero circular dependencies, pure layer boundaries, and 100% EARS/BDD traceability.
  5. Formulate `UniversalProductFoundry.tla` verifying mathematical termination, acyclicity, and boundary isolation.
- **Rejected Alternatives**:
  - Open-ended prompt scaffolding without schemas: Rejected due to violation of Law I (Zero Vibe Coding).
  - Framework-heavy generator (e.g. Yeoman / Create-React-App style): Rejected due to external runtime dependencies and bloated boilerplate.
  - Monolithic single-file project generation: Rejected because complex products require Clean/Hexagonal decoupling.
- **Consequences**:
  - Immediate capability to bootstrap any software product with Big Tech Tier-0 quality.
  - Automated 100% coverage of EARS functional rules mapped to executable BDD scenarios.
  - Mathematical proof of topological stability and clean isolation.
