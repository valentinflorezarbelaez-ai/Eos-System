## 2. ADR-040: NSA Defense-in-Depth, CNSA 2.0 & Red/Black Isolation

### Status
`ACCEPTED` / `IN_PROGRESS`

### Context
Commercial software architectures frequently suffer from timing side-channels, insecure memory cleanup where secret keys persist indefinitely in garbage collector heaps, and lax role-based access control where multi-level security classifications are conflated. To achieve military-grade resilience matching the National Security Agency (NSA) standards and CNSA 2.0, EOS System requires mathematical isolation, strict multi-pass physical buffer zeroization, Red/Black separation, and continuous side-channel anomaly detection.

### Decision
1. **CNSA 2.0 Cryptographic Primitives**: Use `node:crypto` native AES-256-GCM with 96-bit random IVs and 128-bit authentication tags. Bind security classification and compartment names into the Associated Authenticated Data (AAD) to prevent ciphertext transplantation attacks.
2. **Deterministic Memory Zeroization**: In compliance with DoD 5220.22-M standards, all buffers containing private keys or plaintext secrets must be wiped using a 4-pass protocol (`0xAA`, `0x55`, `0x00`, crypto-random noise) directly on the underlying `Buffer` or `Uint8Array`.
3. **Bell-LaPadula Security Lattice**: Enforce strict hierarchical classification levels (`UNCLASSIFIED: 0`, `CONFIDENTIAL: 1`, `SECRET: 2`, `TOP_SECRET: 3`).
   - Simple Security: Subjects cannot read up ($C(S) \ge C(O)$).
   - Star-Property: Subjects cannot write down ($C(S) \le C(O)$).
4. **Red/Black Isolation Boundary**: Plaintext is strictly restricted to RED compartments and can never exit without passing through the cryptographic pipeline to become BLACK ciphertext.
5. **Real-Time Side-Channel Anomaly Detection**: Track execution time variance of cryptographic routines. If variance exceeds statistical anomaly thresholds or if consecutive authentication tag errors occur, trigger immediate fail-closed emergency lockdown and key zeroization.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Absolute protection against timing side-channel attacks, data leakage across security tiers, and memory forensics recovery.
- **Negative / Trade-offs**: Slight computational overhead for multi-pass zeroization and constant-time comparisons (negligible, < 1ms).
