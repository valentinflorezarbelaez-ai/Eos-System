# ARCHITECTURE PLAN & ADR: SAMAELIAN CYBER-THEURGIC SYNTHESIS — IBM & NVIDIA (PLAN-014)

## 1. Architectural Decision Record (ADR-028)

### Context
EOS operates as an autonomous engineering operating system inspired by the highest engineering feats on Earth and the sacred esoteric wisdom.
To achieve absolute resilience and throughput:
1. Systems must resist the Law of Entropy described in the Samaelian Gnostic Alchemical Doctrine (the Law of the Octaves with natural pauses at MI-FA and SI-DO).
2. Mission-critical financial and cloud backbones require IBM Mainframe Parallel Sysplex seven-nines availability (99.99999%) and 2PC XA ACID atomicity.
3. High-density parallel computation requires NVIDIA CUDA SIMT warp architectures (32 threads per warp) executing branchless matrix multiplications without garbage collection pauses.

### Alternatives Considered & Rejected
1. **Relying on standard Node.js event-loop timers for continuous tasks**:
   - *Rejected*: Subject to event-loop drift and GC pauses that break real-time guarantees.
2. **Third-Party Distributed Transaction Coordinators (e.g. Narayana, Atomikos)**:
   - *Rejected*: Adds heavy external Java/C dependencies, violating Layer-0 hexagonal purity (`dependencies: {}`).
3. **GPU Vendor-Specific C++ Bindings**:
   - *Rejected*: Requires native compilation toolchains (NVCC/CUDA SDK) that cannot run in serverless cloud containers. Must provide native Layer-0 SIMD/TypedArray emulation with 0 allocations.

### Decision
Implement `EosSamaelIbmNvidiaCore` in pure Layer-0 TypeScript (`dependencies: {}`):
- **Samaelian Octave Engine**: Tracks the 7 notes (DO to SI) and forces conscious shocks at MI-FA (AST validation) and SI-DO (Merkle cryptographic sealing).
- **IBM Parallel Sysplex Engine**: Emulates Coupling Facility lock structures, Two-Phase Commit (2PC) state machine, zero-downtime microcode updates, and 99.99999% SLA verification.
- **NVIDIA CUDA SIMT Warp Engine**: 32-thread warp scheduler with lock-free register shuffling (`warpShuffle`) and branchless FP16/FP32 tensor matrix multiplications on a contiguous 64KB ArrayBuffer.
