# PLAN-030: IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE FOR BIG TECH TIER-0 HYPER-PERFECTION

## 1. Architectural Design & ADR-043

### ADR-043: Citadel HFT IPC Daemon, SpaceX Zero-Copy Mechanical Sympathy & Netflix Autonomous Chaos Engine
- **Status**: ACCEPTED
- **Context**: EOS System requires sub-millisecond execution speeds for polyglot native acceleration, 0 B/op zero-copy memory efficiency during token analysis, and automated in-process chaos resilience under Byzantine conditions.
- **Decision**:
  1. Implement `EosGoDaemonIpc` as a persistent process controller with bidirectional streaming over stdio, watchdog timeouts, and graceful TypeScript L0 failover.
  2. Implement `EosZeroCopyScanner` operating directly on byte buffers (`Uint8Array` / `Buffer`) with pre-allocated `Int32Array` span records to eliminate temporary string allocations in V8.
  3. Implement `EosAutonomousChaosRunner` featuring controlled latency injection, Byzantine bit-flips, network partition simulation, and an automated 3-state Circuit Breaker (`CLOSED`, `OPEN`, `HALF_OPEN`).
  4. Formulate TLA+ model `AutonomousChaosDisruptor.tla` verifying safety, monotonic message sequencing, and deadlock-free circuit convergence.
- **Rejected Alternatives**:
  - Spawning on each request (`execFileSync`): Rejected due to 15ms cold start penalty.
  - Native Node.js C++ Addon (N-API): Rejected to preserve zero external build dependencies and hermetic Layer-0 cross-platform portability.
  - String regex parsing: Rejected due to GC pressure and heap fragmentation during burst loads.
- **Consequences**:
  - HFT-grade turnaround (< 200µs per native request).
  - 0 B/op heap allocation during token scanning.
  - Deterministic chaos score and resilient failure isolation.
