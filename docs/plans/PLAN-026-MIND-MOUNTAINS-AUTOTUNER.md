## 2. ADR-038: Pure Layer-0 Autotuning & Mind Stratification
- **Context**: EOS must provide extreme self-awareness, psychological clarity, and runtime performance without relying on heavy external libraries, ML runtimes, or network calls.
- **Decision**:
  1. Use deterministic mathematical mappings for the 49 levels of the mind, modeling the attenuation of subconscious defense mechanisms and the percentage of liberated consciousness.
  2. Implement `EosAdaptiveL0Autotuner` using native `perf_hooks.performance.now()`, `process.memoryUsage()`, and `v8.getHeapStatistics()`, dynamically resizing the ring buffer capacity to power-of-two values (1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536) according to instantaneous queue pressure.
  3. Keep all algorithms pure $O(1)$ or $O(N)$ with $N \le 49$, guaranteeing sub-millisecond execution.
- **Alternatives Rejected**:
  1. *Heavy Python / ML background daemon*: Rejected due to high memory footprint (>200MB) and non-deterministic latency.
  2. *Static buffer allocations*: Rejected because static sizing either wastes memory or causes backpressure under burst traffic.
- **Consequences**:
  - Positive: Memory footprint remains below 15MB; execution time is microsecond-fast; zero dependencies; full alignment with Valentín's life goals and Gnostic doctrine.
