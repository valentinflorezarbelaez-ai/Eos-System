# INTAKE-028: PLANETARY DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS, TRUETIME UNCERTAINTY BOUNDS & ADAPTIVE CONCURRENCY LIMITS
<!-- Formal SDD Intake Package — ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 Standard -->

## 1. Context & Business Intent
The Principal Architect requested advancing EOS System to the highest echelon of Big Tech distributed systems engineering (Google Spanner, Netflix Chaos/Resilience, and Cloudflare Edge):
1. **Google Spanner TrueTime Uncertainty Bounds & Linearizability**:
   - Simulated TrueTime clock providing deterministic time intervals $[t_{earliest}, t_{latest}]$ bounded by an uncertainty parameter $\epsilon$.
   - Commit-wait mechanism guaranteeing external consistency (linearizability) across distributed nodes without cross-continent coordination.
2. **Planetary Raft/Paxos Quorum Consensus**:
   - Monotonic terms, leader election with majority voting ($Q = \lfloor N/2 \rfloor + 1$), and split-brain prevention.
   - Replicated state machine with log matching invariant and Merkle state hashes.
3. **Netflix Vegas Adaptive Concurrency Limiter (Little's Law & TCP Vegas/BBR)**:
   - Dynamic real-time calculation of concurrency limits based on minimum vs. smoothed Round Trip Time ($RTT_{min}$ vs. $RTT_{smooth}$).
   - Proactive load-shedding to prevent cascading failure, queue inflation, and bufferbloat under extreme spike conditions.
4. **Scope & Layer-0 Invariants**:
   - 100% Layer-0 Purity: Zero runtime npm dependencies (`dependencies: {}`), using exclusively Node.js native primitives (`node:crypto`, `node:perf_hooks`).
   - Landing page files (`index.html`, `css/eos.css`) strictly sealed and untouched.

## 2. Stakeholders & Roles
- **Principal Architect**: Valentín Flórez Arbeláez (System Owner).
- **Distributed Systems Co-Pilot**: EOS JARVIS Sovereign Monad.
- **Reference Standards**: Google Spanner (OSDI 2012), Raft (USENIX ATC 2014), Netflix Concurrency Limits / TCP Vegas (RFC 1644).

## 3. High-Level Requirements Overview
- **REQ-001**: TrueTime Bounded Clock & Commit-Wait Engine (`src/core/eosTrueTimeBoundedClock.ts`).
- **REQ-002**: Planetary Raft/Paxos Quorum Consensus Engine (`src/core/eosPlanetaryConsensusEngine.ts`).
- **REQ-003**: Netflix Vegas Adaptive Concurrency Limiter (`src/core/eosAdaptiveConcurrencyLimiter.ts`).
- **REQ-004**: Multi-channel CLI & MCP Server tools (`eos_consensus_status`, `eos_truetime_now`, `eos_adaptive_concurrency_stats`).
- **REQ-005**: Strict BDD Test Suite (`test/eosPlanetaryConsensusAdaptiveConcurrency.test.mjs`) integrated into the 7-stage CI/CD gate.
