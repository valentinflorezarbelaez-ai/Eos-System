# INTAKE-027: NSA DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH & CNSA 2.0 POST-QUANTUM ZERO-TRUST ENGINE
<!-- Formal SDD Intake Package — ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 Standard -->

## 1. Context & Business Intent
The Principal Architect requested advancing EOS System to the operational and cybersecurity standards of the **NSA (National Security Agency)**, specifically incorporating:
1. **CNSA 2.0 (Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0)** symmetric and post-quantum migration benchmarks:
   - Military-grade AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption with strict synthetic/deterministic IV generation and Associated Authenticated Data (AAD) binding security compartment metadata.
   - SHA-384 / SHA-512 cryptographic digests for all ledger and security event attestation.
   - Constant-time cryptographic comparison (`timingSafeEqual`) to defeat timing side-channel attacks across all security boundaries.
   - Multi-pass memory zeroization (DoD 5220.22-M / NSA zeroize protocol) to securely purge plain secrets and ephemeral keying material from memory.
2. **NSA Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) & Red/Black Physical/Logical Separation**:
   - Red Boundary: Classified plaintext processing isolated strictly in memory.
   - Black Boundary: Only authenticated ciphertext and encrypted payloads cross boundary gates.
   - Mandatory Access Control (MAC) following Bell-LaPadula lattice invariants (`UNCLASSIFIED`, `CONFIDENTIAL`, `SECRET`, `TOP_SECRET`) with non-bypassable clearance checks.
3. **Continuous Anomaly Detection & Fail-Closed Emergency Purge**:
   - Real-time side-channel anomaly detection (timing variance, unauthorized clearance escalation).
   - Instant fail-closed cryptographic shutdown with zero-entropy in-place buffer wipe.
4. **Scope & Layer-0 Invariants**:
   - Pure Layer-0: Zero external npm dependencies (`dependencies: {}`), using exclusively Node.js native primitives (`node:crypto`, `node:perf_hooks`, `node:v8`).
   - Landing page files (`index.html`, `css/eos.css`) strictly sealed and untouched.

## 2. Stakeholders & Roles
- **Principal Architect**: Valentín Flórez Arbeláez (System Owner).
- **Security & Cryptography Co-Pilot**: EOS JARVIS Sovereign Monad.
- **Compliance Standard**: NSA CNSA 2.0, DoD 5220.22-M, NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust).

## 3. High-Level Requirements Overview
- **REQ-001**: CNSA 2.0 Cryptographic Suite & Memory Zeroizer (`src/core/eosNsaCryptoSuite.ts`).
- **REQ-002**: Red/Black Compartment & Bell-LaPadula Zero-Trust Arbiter (`src/core/eosNsaZeroTrustCompartment.ts`).
- **REQ-003**: Real-time Side-Channel & Timing Anomaly Detector (`src/core/eosNsaAnomalyDetector.ts`).
- **REQ-004**: Multi-channel CLI & MCP Server tools (`eos_nsa_encrypt`, `eos_nsa_zero_trust_check`).
- **REQ-005**: Strict BDD Test Suite (`test/eosNsaZeroTrustDefense.test.mjs`) integrated into the 7-stage CI/CD gate.
