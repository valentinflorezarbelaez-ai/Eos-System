## 1. Context & Business Need
A comprehensive Big Tech architectural audit conducted against Google SRE, Nubank Architecture, Spotify Core Infrastructure, NVIDIA Low-Level Systems, and Anthropic Agent Alignment benchmarks evaluated EOS System at an elite 8.7/10 score. The audit concluded that while EOS possesses unmatched specification discipline (EARS/BDD), Layer-0 dependency purity (`dependencies: {}`), and cryptographic SBOM verification, its primary limitations lie in four critical production dimensions:
1. **Physical Persistence & Durability**: State (bitemporal datoms, memory telemetry) currently resides in volatile RAM. A banking-grade system requires a physical Write-Ahead Log (WAL) with `fsync()` and automatic CRC32 crash recovery.
2. **Hardware Acceleration (WebGPU WGSL)**: The 3D fleet visualizer projects geometry on the main CPU thread. High-scale client rendering requires native WebGPU compute shaders executing matrix transformations directly on GPU hardware.
3. **Industry-Standard Observability (Prometheus & OpenTelemetry)**: Observability is currently exposed as proprietary JSON. SRE teams require standard Prometheus text exposition format (`/metrics`) and W3C distributed tracing headers.
4. **Hermetic Code Execution Sandboxing (Copy-On-Write Overlay)**: Self-healing agents currently mutate disk directly after validation. Safe autonomous operations require isolated copy-on-write (COW) sandboxing where mutations are verified in an ephemeral double-blind sandbox before committing.

## 2. Stakeholder Goals & Invariants
1. **Cryptographic Binary WAL (`eosDurableWal.ts`)**:
   - Magic header `EOSW`, 64-bit monotonically increasing transaction IDs, nanosecond timestamps, CRC32 checksums, and `fsyncSync()` durability.
   - 100% bit-exact recovery after simulated power failure / torn writes.
2. **WebGPU Hardware Compute Shaders (`eos_topology_shader.wgsl` & `eosWebGpuTopology.ts`)**:
   - WGSL compute shader executing 3D rotation and particle physics in parallel GPU workgroups (size 64).
   - Zero-overhead fallback to Canvas 2D/3D in environments lacking WebGPU support.
3. **Prometheus Standard Exporter (`eosPrometheusExporter.ts`)**:
   - Standard `/metrics` route serving gauges, counters, and histograms in Prometheus text format (v0.0.4) for instant Grafana/Datadog compatibility.
4. **Hermetic Copy-On-Write Sandbox (`eosHermeticSandbox.ts`)**:
   - Isolated in-memory overlay filesystem ensuring prospective code patches execute tests in an ephemeral sandbox before committing to real disk.
5. **Layer-0 Purity**: Zero external runtime npm packages (`dependencies: {}`).
