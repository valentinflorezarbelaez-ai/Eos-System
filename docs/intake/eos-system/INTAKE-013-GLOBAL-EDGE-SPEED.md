# INTAKE & CONTEXT RECORD: GLOBAL EDGE ANYCAST & ULTRA-LOW LATENCY SPEED (INTAKE-013)

* **Project**: EOS System Control Plane (`eos-system-control-plane`)
* **Date**: 2026-10-25
* **Author**: Valentín Flórez Arbeláez (Principal Architect)
* **Goal**: Elevate EOS System to global-scale speed and architectural perfection through a distributed Anycast Latency Arbiter, Google Jeff Dean-style Hedged Requests, Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC), and multi-region POP topology.

## 1. Business & Operational Drivers
1. **Global Scale**: The Sovereign Fleet and Big Tech microservices operate across multiple continents (Stockholm, Bogotá, São Paulo, Virginia, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Silicon Valley).
2. **Speed & Latency Invariants**: Eliminating long tail latency (p99) on distributed state synchronization and telemetry retrieval.
3. **Lock-Free Consistency**: Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC) guarantee total causal order across distributed edge nodes without distributed locking or GPS atomic clocks.
4. **Zero-Allocation Edge Cache**: In-memory microsecond cache (< 15 µs) for high-frequency telemetry.

## 2. Inviolable Constraints
- 100% Layer-0 hexagonal purity (`dependencies: {}`).
- Zero plaintext secrets.
- Deterministic exit code 0 on all test suites.
- Professional standard English in artifacts and codebase.
