## 1. Context & Business Need
Following the comprehensive Big Tech architectural audit (Google, Citadel, Stripe, ASML, Netflix, Nubank, Spotify), EOS System achieved a 9.4/10 Tier S rating. To reach an undisputed **10/10 Absolute Perfection Standard**, the system must eliminate every single identified architectural gap without sacrificing Layer-0 purity (`dependencies: {}`) or the inviolable Constitution.

The 5 Pillars required for 10/10 Enterprise Perfection are:
1. **Datalog Predictive Test Selection (PTS) Integration**: Transform `npm test` and CI/CD into a smart sub-second runner that calculates git diffs, computes deductive blast radius via `EosDatalogVerifier`, and executes only affected test suites (< 350ms) during development, while enforcing `--full` for release gates.
2. **Native Go Heavy Motor & Zero-Allocation Bridge**: Move computational heavy-paths (LMAX Disruptor ring buffer, SIMD acoustic/vector dot products, Datalog fast evaluation) to static stripped Go binaries (`-ldflags="-s -w"`) targeting true `0 B/op` heap allocation, eliminating V8 garbage collection jitter.
3. **Formal Mathematical Specifications (TLA+ / Machine-Checked Models)**: Establish `docs/formal/` containing formal TLA+ specifications proving safety and liveness invariants for the LMAX Disruptor (`LmaxDisruptor.tla`), Datomic Bitemporal Ledger (`DatomicBitemporalLedger.tla`), and Hermes Distributed Consensus (`HermesConsensusMesh.tla`), backed by a Layer-0 syntax and state invariant verification engine.
4. **Jepsen-Style Network Partition & Chaos Hypervisor**: Expand `EosTimeTravelSim` with dynamic network bipartitions ($A \not\leftrightarrow B$), packet drop probability ($P_{drop}$), and clock skew injection to stress-test RPC mesh quorums and circuit breaker transitions under distributed chaos.
5. **Hardened Pinned Memory Vault (`EosSecureMemoryVault`)**: Implement zero-copy non-serializable Uint8Array buffers with deterministic in-place memory wiping via `crypto.randomFillSync()` to prevent secret residue from surviving in V8 scavenge heaps.

## 2. Invariants & Acceptance Boundaries
1. **Layer-0 Purity**: Zero external dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
2. **Landing Page Sealed**: 0 modifications to `index.html` or `css/eos.css`. Focus is strictly "SOLO EOS".
3. **100% CI/CD Verification**: All test suites must pass cleanly with Exit Code 0 across all 7 stages.
4. **Sub-Second PTS**: Incremental tests must evaluate and pass in under 500ms.
5. **English Code & Specs**: All code, comments, specs, and commits in standard professional English.
