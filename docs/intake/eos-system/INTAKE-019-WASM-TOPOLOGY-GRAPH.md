## 1. Context & Business Need
EOS System currently features high-performance native Go engines (`bin/eos-apex.exe`, `bin/eos-spotify.exe`) delivering over 1 billion tokens/second processing speed on multi-threaded servers. However, when users interact directly with the client-side landing page (`https://eos-system-ten.vercel.app/`), client-side context compression, token estimation, and benchmark calculations either run via TypeScript heuristics or require serverless API hops.

To achieve Big Tech parity with top-tier tools (Figma, Zed, Devin, Cursor), the client browser should execute compiled native Go routines directly via WebAssembly (WASM) at zero latency (< 1ms). Furthermore, to visualize the entire sovereign architecture and system interconnectedness, an interactive 3D Canvas Topology Graph must be rendered client-side, showing the 4 Sovereign Fleet Nodes, 6 Core Engines, and 4 Runtime Nodes with live blast-radius calculation and particle-accelerated edge routing.

## 2. Stakeholder Goals & Invariants
1. **Client-Side Go Execution**: Compile a specialized Go WASM kernel (`assets/eos_apex.wasm`) that exports token estimation, AST outline squeezing, and concurrency benchmarking directly to the browser runtime via `window.eosGoWasm`.
2. **Zero-Latency Fallback**: If WebAssembly is unsupported or disabled, seamlessly fall back to Layer-0 TypeScript heuristics without crashing or degrading UI responsiveness.
3. **Interactive 3D Fleet Topology Graph**: Render an interactive 3D Canvas visualizer (`#eos-fleet-topology-canvas`) mapping the 14 Sovereign nodes across 3 architectural rings (Sovereign Platforms, Core Engines, Runtime Kernels), supporting 3D rotation, hover inspection, node selection, blast radius calculation, and real-time telemetry.
4. **Zero-Allocation & Strict Invariants**:
   - Zero external npm packages (`dependencies: {}`).
   - Core Web Vitals 100/100 (CLS < 0.01, LCP < 2.5s, INP < 100ms).
   - Subresource Integrity (SRI) SHA-384 locked.
   - All tests passing with exit code 0.
