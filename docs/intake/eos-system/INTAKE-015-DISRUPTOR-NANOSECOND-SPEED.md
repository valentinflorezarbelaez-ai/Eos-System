# INTAKE & CONTEXT RECORD: LMAX DISRUPTOR RING BUFFER & NANOSECOND SPEED (INTAKE-015)

* **Project**: EOS System Control Plane (`eos-system-control-plane`)
* **Date**: 2026-10-25
* **Author**: Valentín Flórez Arbeláez (Principal Architect)
* **Goal**: Optimize EOS System to absolute maximum execution speed and nanosecond efficiency using an in-memory LMAX Disruptor lock-free ring buffer, zero-copy structural byte-scanning, and incremental compilation cache.

## 1. Architectural Drivers & Bottlenecks
1. **Garbage Collection (GC) Elimination**: Traditional event busses allocate event wrapper objects on the heap, triggering minor and major GC pauses (5ms to 50ms).
2. **LMAX Disruptor Architecture**:
   - Circular pre-allocated ring buffer sized to a power of two ($2^N$).
   - Bitwise AND wrapping: `sequence & (bufferSize - 1)`.
   - Monotonic atomic sequence cursors.
   - Zero allocations during message publishing and consumption ($0 \text{ B/op}$).
   - Throughput exceeding 10,000,000 events/second with sub-100ns latency.
3. **Cache-Line Alignment (64 Bytes)**:
   - False-sharing prevention: sequence counters padded to 64 bytes to prevent cache line invalidation ping-pong across CPU cores.
4. **Structural Fast-Path Byte Scanning**:
   - Cache-line chunk scanning (64 bytes) for structural telemetry delimiters without full string decoding.

## 2. Inviolable Invariants
- 100% Layer-0 hexagonal architecture (`dependencies: {}`).
- Zero plaintext secrets.
- Deterministic exit code 0 across all verification stages.
- Professional standard English in codebase and documentation.
