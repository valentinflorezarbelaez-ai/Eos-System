# INTAKE-030: BIG TECH TIER-0 HYPER-PERFECTION (CITADEL HFT IPC, SPACEX ZERO-COPY & NETFLIX CHAOS RUNNER)

## 1. Context & Business Intent
- **System**: EOS System (Engineering Operating System)
- **Target Tier**: Big Tech Tier-0 Hyper-Perfection (Citadel HFT, SpaceX/ASML Mechanical Sympathy, Netflix Chaos Engineering)
- **Problem Statement**:
  1. *Citadel IPC Overrun*: Executing compiled Go binaries via per-request child process spawning (`execFileSync` / `spawnSync`) incurs an unavoidable ~15ms cold start penalty per execution, limiting throughput under high-frequency agentic loops.
  2. *SpaceX/ASML Heap Churn*: High-throughput AST token scanning and pattern matching allocates intermediate string slices, triggering V8 Garbage Collection pauses and breaking 0 B/op allocations.
  3. *Netflix In-Process Fault Tolerance*: Codebase resilience to unexpected network jitters, Byzantine data corruptions, and cascading circuit failures is currently tested discretely rather than verified dynamically by an autonomous in-process chaos engine.

- **Architectural Solution**:
  1. **Citadel HFT Persistent IPC Daemon (`EosGoDaemonIpc`)**: Maintain a long-lived resident background process communicating via length-prefixed streaming protocol over stdio, dropping execution turnaround to sub-millisecond (< 200µs) with automatic failover to in-process TypeScript L0.
  2. **SpaceX / ASML Zero-Copy Scanner (`EosZeroCopyScanner`)**: Direct buffer parsing using `Uint8Array` views and pre-allocated `Int32Array` token span tables `[start, end, type]`, achieving 0 heap string allocations (0 B/op) and TurboFan monomorphic speed.
  3. **Netflix Autonomous Chaos Runner (`EosAutonomousChaosRunner`)**: In-process chaos engine supporting synthetic latency injection, Byzantine payload mutation, and simulated partition timeouts with a 3-state Circuit Breaker (`CLOSED`, `OPEN`, `HALF_OPEN`) and resilience scoring (0-100).

## 2. Inviolable Invariants
- 0 external runtime dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
- Production binaries compile with `-ldflags="-s -w"`.
- All code in standard professional English with full BDD unit test coverage.
