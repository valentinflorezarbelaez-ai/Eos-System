# INTAKE-029: AMAZON DYNAMO CONSISTENT HASHING, ANTI-ENTROPY MERKLE SYNC & CLOUDFLARE MICROSECOND TOKEN-BUCKET

## 1. Context & Business Intent
- **System**: EOS System (Engineering Operating System)
- **Target Tier**: Big Tech Apex (Amazon Dynamo, Cloudflare Edge, Apache Cassandra)
- **Problem Statement**:
  - As nodes join or leave a globally distributed cluster, traditional modulo hashing (`hash(key) % N`) causes $O(K)$ keys to migrate, producing catastrophic network rehash storms.
  - Replicas across continents drift in state due to network partitions, requiring bandwidth-intensive scans to synchronize.
  - Edge interfaces under high-traffic spikes require sub-microsecond rate-limiting with burst tolerance to prevent backend DDoS.
- **Architectural Solution**:
  1. Amazon Dynamo consistent hash ring with virtual nodes ($V=64$) for $O(\log M)$ lookup and minimal key migration ($\approx K/N$).
  2. Dynamo anti-entropy synchronization using hierarchical Merkle Trees to locate divergent ranges in $O(\log K)$ comparisons.
  3. Cloudflare-grade microsecond token-bucket rate limiter with monotonic time tracking (`hrtime.bigint()`) and zero allocations.

## 2. Inviolable Invariants
- 0 external runtime dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
- Landing page files (`index.html`, `css/eos.css`) strictly sealed.
- All code in standard professional English with full unit test coverage.
