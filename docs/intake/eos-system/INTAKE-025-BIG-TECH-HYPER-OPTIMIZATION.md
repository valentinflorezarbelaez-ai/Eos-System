## 1. Context & Business Intent
The Principal Architect requested hyper-optimizing the EOS System using the exact architectural techniques employed by Tier-1 Big Tech engineering teams (Google Core, Meta Infra, Citadel HFT, Netflix Edge, Cloudflare):
1. **Loop Unrolling & Superscalar Instruction Pipeline Optimization**: 4x-unrolled CRC32 and 64-bit FNV-1a hashing maximizing CPU Instructions-Per-Cycle (IPC > 2.5).
2. **Zero-Allocation Slab Buffer Pool (`EosBufferPool`)**: Pre-allocated, recyclable slab buffers eliminating V8 Garbage Collection (GC) pauses during high-frequency telemetry, WAL serialization, and SSE streaming.
3. **Monomorphic Inline Caching & V8 JIT Health Profiler (`EosApexProfiler`)**: Profiling hot execution paths to guarantee monomorphic V8 call sites and zero deoptimization bailouts.

## 2. Inviolable Constraints
- **Zero Vibe Coding**: Formal EARS syntax and Gherkin BDD criteria.
- **Layer-0 Purity**: Zero external npm runtime dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
- **SLSA Level 4 Compliance**: Cryptographic integrity and zero plain secrets.
- **Strict Verification Gate**: 100% pass across all 7 CI/CD aduanas with exit code 0.
