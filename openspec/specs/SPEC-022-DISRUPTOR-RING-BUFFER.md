# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: LMAX DISRUPTOR LOCK-FREE RING BUFFER & SPEED ENGINE (SPEC-022)

## 1. Scope
Governs high-throughput, zero-allocation in-memory event streaming, lock-free circular ring buffer sequencing, 64-byte cache line padding to prevent false sharing, and nanosecond structural byte scanning across the EOS control plane and sovereign fleet.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL operate an in-memory LMAX Disruptor circular ring buffer with power-of-two capacity ($2^N$) and bitwise index masking (`seq & (capacity - 1)`) using zero external dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL pre-allocate contiguous TypedArray memory (Float64Array / BigInt64Array / Uint8Array) ensuring strictly zero heap object allocation ($0 \text{ B/op}$) during event publishing and consuming loops.
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: WHILE multiple producers and consumers publish telemetry to the ring buffer, THE SYSTEM SHALL advance cursors monotonically without mutual exclusion locks (Mutexes), achieving throughput exceeding 10,000,000 events/second.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL apply 64-byte cache line alignment and padding to sequence counters, eliminating CPU cache line contention and false sharing.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN JSON or telemetry payloads are ingested, THE SYSTEM SHALL execute a zero-copy 64-byte chunk byte scanner to identify structural delimiters (`{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `:`) at over 1,500 MB/second without recursive string allocations.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL output a cryptographic SHA-256 Merkle receipt attesting to nanosecond latency benchmarks and zero-allocation compliance.
