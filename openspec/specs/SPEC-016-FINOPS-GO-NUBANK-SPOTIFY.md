# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: SPOTIFY & NUBANK DUAL-ENGINE FINOPS ARCHITECTURE (SPEC-016)

## 1. Scope
Governs the 90/10 architectural doctrine (90% Go cloud microservices, 10% Rust DSP kernels), FinOps cloud billing optimization, Distroless containerization (< 12MB images), atomic idempotency token validation (banking-grade Nubank & royalty-grade Spotify), race condition detection (`-race`), and zero-allocation memory benchmarks.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL implement the 90/10 architectural rule, executing 90% of business logic, high-concurrency event processing, and APIs in Go standard library with zero runtime dependencies (`dependencies: {}`), and 10% in Rust for low-level audio DSP kernels.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE GO MICROSERVICE SHALL compile to a single static binary with stripped debug symbols (`-ldflags="-s -w"`) packaged into a distroless/scratch container strictly smaller than 12 Megabytes.
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: WHILE processing financial billing or stream playback events, THE SYSTEM SHALL guarantee idempotent deduplication via atomic in-memory or distributed token registries, discarding duplicate retries without duplicate side-effects.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN automated test gates are triggered by autonomous agents, THE PIPELINE SHALL execute data race detection (`go test -race ./...`) and memory allocation benchmarks (`go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...`), rejecting any code containing data races or memory leaks.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL export Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`) tracking total requests, active concurrent sessions, and average latency in microseconds, alongside CNCF health probes (`/healthz`).
- **ERROR/UNWANTED**: IF an upstream dependency or node fails, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL degrade gracefully, absorbing transient faults and terminating gracefully on SIGINT/SIGTERM within a 5-second timeout window.
