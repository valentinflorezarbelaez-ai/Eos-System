# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: GO NATIVE TITAN ACCELERATOR (SPEC-011)

## 1. Scope
Governs high-concurrency native Go execution, goroutine-based audio streaming buffers, SIMD acoustic vector operations, and Spotify BaRT (Bandits for Recommendations as Treatments) algorithms.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain zero external runtime dependencies (`dependencies: {}`), utilizing Go's native standard library for compiled acceleration.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN the native accelerator is invoked, THE SYSTEM SHALL execute concurrent goroutine streaming pipelines achieving $> 1,000$ MB/s throughput.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL calculate 8D acoustic vector cosine similarities at $> 10,000,000$ operations per second.
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: WHILE running playlist optimization, THE SYSTEM SHALL execute Thompson Sampling with Beta distributions to balance exploration vs. exploitation.
- **ERROR/UNWANTED**: IF the Go binary or runtime is missing on the host, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL gracefully fall back to Layer-0 TypeScript without crashing or throwing unhandled errors.
