# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: SPOTIFY XIRP & AUDIO CODEX (SPEC-004)

## 1. Scope
Governs Spotify-grade engineering excellence, Backstage RFC-42 Golden Paths, ITU-R BS.1770 -14 LUFS loudness normalization, and 8D acoustic vector recommendation math.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL validate repository conformance against Backstage RFC-42 catalog specifications (`catalog-info.yaml`).
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce standard integrated audio normalization to -14.0 LUFS with a -1.0 dB True Peak ceiling.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN two audio tracks are evaluated for continuous playback flow, THE SYSTEM SHALL calculate 8-dimensional cosine vector similarity combined with Camelot Wheel harmonic key compatibility.
- **ERROR/UNWANTED**: IF a target repository lacks a valid Backstage descriptor or exhibits architectural layer bleeding, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL flag Golden Path non-compliance and synthesize actionable remediations.
