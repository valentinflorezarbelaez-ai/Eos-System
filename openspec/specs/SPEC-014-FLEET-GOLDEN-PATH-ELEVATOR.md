# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: FLEET GOLDEN PATH ELEVATOR (SPEC-014)

## 1. Scope
Governs the systematic discovery, architectural audit, and elevation of all fleet repositories (including Aberamentho, Portafolio, Performance Talent Group, and EOS Sovereign Control Plane) to Spotify Backstage RFC-42 Golden Path standards.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain an audit of all fleet repositories registered in `docs/projects/registry.json`.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN fleet elevation is triggered, THE SYSTEM SHALL verify the presence and schema validity of `catalog-info.yaml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`.
- **ERROR-DRIVEN**: IF any fleet repository lacks Backstage Golden Path artifacts, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL synthesize standardized RFC-42 manifests without corrupting existing application logic.
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: WHILE running in dry-run mode, THE SYSTEM SHALL output an elevation index and readiness percentage without writing changes to target directories.
