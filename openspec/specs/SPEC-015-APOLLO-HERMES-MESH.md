# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: SPOTIFY APOLLO / HERMES RPC & EVENT MESH (SPEC-015)

## 1. Scope
Governs high-throughput, low-latency inter-service RPC communication, event pub/sub routing, resilient circuit breaking, and W3C distributed tracing modeled after Spotify's Apollo framework and Hermes messaging mesh.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL route asynchronous RPC calls and pub/sub events using zero external dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: WHILE tracking downstream endpoint reliability, THE SYSTEM SHALL operate a 3-state Circuit Breaker (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN) with sliding window error rate calculation and exponential backoff recovery.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL generate and propagate W3C Distributed Tracing headers (`traceparent`) across all RPC requests and event dispatches to preserve causal telemetry.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN incoming request rate exceeds token bucket capacity, THE SYSTEM SHALL reject or queue requests with deterministic backpressure (`429 Too Many Requests` semantics).
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL calculate 32-bit FNV-1a partition hashes for topic partitioning across virtual shards.
