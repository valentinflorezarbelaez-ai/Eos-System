# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: REAL-TIME ACOUSTIC FEATURE STORE (SPEC-018)

## 1. Scope
Governs the real-time sliding-window feature aggregation, user taste profile centroid tracking with exponential half-life decay, and online/offline point-in-time correctness modeled after Spotify Scio and Feast.

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL calculate 8-dimensional user taste centroids (tempo, energy, danceability, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness) using typed memory with zero heap reallocations.
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: WHILE streaming user listening events, THE SYSTEM SHALL apply exponential decay weighting ($\lambda = \ln(2) / \tau$) to historical tracks to adapt dynamically to current session preference drift.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN a track skip occurs before 30 seconds of playback, THE SYSTEM SHALL apply a negative feedback vector penalty to the active session centroid.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL guarantee point-in-time correctness for recommendation models, ensuring evaluations strictly use historical feature vectors available at query timestamp $t_0$.
