# OPENSPEC BASE SPECIFICATION: TURBO ENGINE & SEMANTIC CODE GRAPH (SPEC-007)

## 1. Scope
Governs content-addressed verification caching, microsecond telemetry, directed AST code graphs, downstream blast radius, and predictive test selection (PTS).

## 2. Requirements (EARS)
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL index exported symbols, interfaces, and module dependency edges into a directed semantic code graph with zero external runtime dependencies.
- **EVENT-DRIVEN**: WHEN a source file is inspected or mutated, THE SYSTEM SHALL compute the transitive downstream Blast Radius in sub-millisecond time.
- **STATE-DRIVEN**: WHILE running unchanged files, THE SYSTEM SHALL serve verification results from an in-memory SHA-256 content-addressed cache.
- **UBIQUITOUS**: THE SYSTEM SHALL provide Predictive Test Selection (PTS) to execute only the test suites impacted by candidate mutations.
