## 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Scope
Following the formal engineering audit by Big Tech principles (Google, Citadel, Stripe, ASML, Netflix, Nubank, Spotify), `SPEC-030` formalizes the 5 foundational pillars required to achieve an undisputed 10/10 Enterprise Engineering Perfection score:
1. **Datalog Smart Predictive Test Selection (PTS)**: Real-time git-diff blast radius analysis running only impacted suites in < 500ms.
2. **Native Go Heavy-Motor Accelerator**: Zero-allocation (`0 B/op`) static Go binary execution for Disruptor ring buffers, SIMD acoustic math, and Datalog fixpoint evaluation.
3. **Formal Mathematical Specifications (TLA+)**: Executable, machine-checked TLA+ formal specifications proving lock-freedom, bitemporal serializability, and distributed quorum safety.
4. **Jepsen-Style Chaos Monkey Hypervisor**: Network bipartitions, packet dropping, and clock skew simulation inside deterministic discrete event time-travel.
5. **Hardened Pinned Memory Vault (`EosSecureMemoryVault`)**: Zero-copy byte buffer containment with in-place cryptographic memory wipes eliminating V8 garbage collection heap leakage.

## 2. Functional Requirements (EARS Standard)

### FR-069: Smart Predictive Test Selection (PTS) Integration
- **Event-Driven**: WHEN `npm test` or `eos pts` is invoked in incremental mode, THE SYSTEM SHALL calculate modified files via git status, query `EosDatalogVerifier` for transitive blast radius, and execute only the impacted test suites in under 500 milliseconds.
- **State-Driven**: WHILE running in release gate mode (`verify:strict` or pre-push), THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce execution of 100% of the complete 30+ test suites.

### FR-070: Native Go Heavy-Motor & Zero-Allocation Bridge
- **Ubiquitous**: THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a native Go acceleration kernel in `src/native/eos_apex_orchestrator.go` that executes lockless Disruptor sequencing and vector mathematics with strictly zero heap allocations (`0 B/op`).
- **Event-Driven**: WHEN high-scale concurrency operations exceed 100,000 events/sec, THE SYSTEM SHALL route execution through the Go native binary or WebAssembly kernel.

### FR-071: TLA+ Formal Mathematical Specifications
- **Ubiquitous**: THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain formal TLA+ mathematical models in `docs/formal/` covering the LMAX Disruptor (`LmaxDisruptor.tla`), Datomic Bitemporal Ledger (`DatomicBitemporalLedger.tla`), and Hermes Distributed Consensus (`HermesConsensusMesh.tla`).
- **Event-Driven**: WHEN `node scripts/verify-formal-tla.mjs` is executed, THE SYSTEM SHALL parse and formally verify state transition invariants, safety, and liveness properties.

### FR-072: Jepsen-Style Distributed Chaos Monkey Hypervisor
- **Event-Driven**: WHEN `isolatePartition(nodesA, nodesB)` is invoked in `EosTimeTravelSim`, THE SYSTEM SHALL drop cross-partition RPC messages and verify that consensus replicas enter safe minority fallback without split-brain corruption.
- **Event-Driven**: WHEN the network partition heals, THE SYSTEM SHALL deterministically reconcile state across all replicas and reach identical Merkle state hashes.

### FR-073: Hardened Pinned Memory Vault
- **Ubiquitous**: THE SYSTEM SHALL allocate sensitive keys and cryptographic tokens inside `EosSecureMemoryVault` using raw non-serializable byte arrays without string instantiation.
- **Event-Driven**: WHEN `vault.wipe(tokenId)` is invoked, THE SYSTEM SHALL overwrite the buffer in-place using cryptographic pseudo-random noise (`crypto.randomFillSync`) followed by zeros, guaranteeing zero entropy residue.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (BDD Standard)

```gherkin
SCENARIO: Smart Datalog Predictive Test Selection Execution
  GIVEN a modified working tree with changes only in "src/core/eosDisruptorRingEngine.ts"
  WHEN the developer runs "eos pts" or smart incremental test runner
  THEN Datalog calculates the deductive blast radius in under 50 milliseconds
  AND only test/eosDisruptorRingEngine.test.mjs is dispatched
  AND total test cycle executes in under 500 milliseconds.

SCENARIO: TLA+ Formal Model Verification
  GIVEN formal TLA+ specifications in docs/formal/
  WHEN the formal verification gate runs
  THEN all state machine transitions satisfy safety and liveness invariants
  AND zero deadlock states or race conditions are detected.

SCENARIO: Jepsen-Style Network Partition and Re-convergence
  GIVEN a 3-node simulated cluster (replica-1, replica-2, replica-3)
  WHEN a network partition isolates replica-3 from {replica-1, replica-2}
  THEN replica-1 and replica-2 maintain quorum while replica-3 enters minority standby
  AND WHEN the partition is healed, all 3 replicas reconcile to identical state hash.

SCENARIO: Hardened Memory Vault Zero-Entropy Wipe
  GIVEN an allocated secret token inside EosSecureMemoryVault
  WHEN the vault destroys the token
  THEN memory bytes are overwritten with cryptographic noise and zeroed in-place
  AND zero plaintext byte patterns survive in heap buffers.
```

## 4. Architectural Boundaries & Layer-0 Purity
- Zero external runtime npm dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
- The landing page presentation (`index.html`, `css/eos.css`) remains 100% untouched and sealed.
- All code modules reside in `src/core/`, `src/native/`, `docs/formal/`, and `test/`.
