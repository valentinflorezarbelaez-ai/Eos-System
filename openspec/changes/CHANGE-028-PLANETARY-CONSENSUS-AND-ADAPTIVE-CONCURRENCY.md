# CHANGE-028: PLANETARY DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS, TRUETIME & ADAPTIVE CONCURRENCY ENGINE
<!-- Formal OpenSpec Delta Change Specification -->

## 1. Change Intent
Equip EOS System with the industry-standard distributed systems mechanisms pioneered by Google and Netflix: Google Spanner TrueTime bounded clock with commit-wait linearizability, Planetary Raft/Paxos quorum consensus with split-brain immunity, and Netflix Vegas dynamic concurrency limits with proactive load-shedding.

## 2. Added Modules
1. `src/core/eosTrueTimeBoundedClock.ts`: TrueTime clock interval $[t_{earliest}, t_{latest}]$, oscillator drift estimation, and commit-wait external consistency.
2. `src/core/eosPlanetaryConsensusEngine.ts`: Monotonic term elections, leader leases, log replication with quorum commitment ($Q = \lfloor N/2 \rfloor + 1$).
3. `src/core/eosAdaptiveConcurrencyLimiter.ts`: TCP Vegas adaptive concurrency limiter monitoring $RTT_{min}$ vs $RTT$, queue inflation detection, and load-shedding.
4. `test/eosPlanetaryConsensusAdaptiveConcurrency.test.mjs`: Master test suite verifying BDD-090 to BDD-093.

## 3. Modified Modules
1. `bin/eos.mjs`: Added CLI subcommands `consensus`, `truetime`, `concurrency`.
2. `src/mcp/eosMcpServer.ts`: Added tools `eos_consensus_status`, `eos_truetime_now`, `eos_adaptive_concurrency_stats`.
3. `package.json`: Version bumped to `42.0.0`.
4. `scripts/verify-cicd-pipeline.mjs`: Registered `test/eosPlanetaryConsensusAdaptiveConcurrency.test.mjs` as Suite 37.
5. `scripts/verify-landing.mjs`: Assert presence of new core modules and test file.
6. `AGENTS.md`: Updated active spec count to 37.
7. `IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZATION.md`: Documented CHANGE-028 / SPEC-035 authorization.

## 4. Invariants
- 100% Layer-0 Purity: Zero runtime npm dependencies (`dependencies: {}`).
- Landing page files (`index.html`, `css/eos.css`) strictly sealed and untouched.
- All CI/CD strict stages pass with Exit Code 0.
